## Classes
JavaScript doesn’t have a traditional class system. Instead, it has prototypes. Prototypes can be extremely versatile and powerful, but they’re confusing to novices. Hence, CoffeeScript has created a traditional class system.

Instead of repetitively attaching functions to a prototype, CoffeeScript provides a basic class structure that allows you to name your class, set the superclass, assign prototypal properties, and define the constructor, in a single assignable expression.

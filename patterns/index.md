## Design Patterns

One of the most important aspects of writing maintainable code is being able to notice the recurring themes in that code and
 optimize them. This is an area where knowledge of design patterns can prove invaluable.

A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
Another way of looking at patterns are as templates for how we solve problems - ones which can be used in quite a few
different situations.

So, why is it important to understand patterns and be familiar with them? Design patterns have three main benefits:

  * Patterns are proven solutions: They provide solid approaches to solving issues in software development using proven
    techniques that reflect the experience and insights the developers that helped define them bring to the pattern.
  * Patterns can be easily reused: A pattern usually reflects an out of the box solution that can be adapted to suit
    our own needs. This feature makes them quite robust.
  * Patterns can be expressive: When we look at a pattern there’s generally a set structure and vocabulary to the
    solution presented that can help express rather large solutions quite elegantly.

Patterns are not an exact solution. It’s important that we remember the role of a pattern is merely to provide us with a
solution scheme. Patterns don’t solve all design problems nor do they replace good software designers, however, they do
support them.

So, let's have a look at most common design patterns in JavaScript and how they can be implemented in CoffeeScript.

## Conclusion

That's all for this introductory adventure into the world of CoffeeScript and writing syntactically awesome frontend code - I hope you have found it helpful and fun.

CoffeScript is a great tool to use for beginners and for experienced developer, as it is quick and easy to learn.
It increases code expressiveness, speeds up development and simplifies maintainability and protects you from running into
multiple pitfalls you have with JavaScript.

The contents of this book should hopefully provide sufficient information to get started using CoffeScript in development
of web applications and having fun while working on open source products.

We've covered object-oriented abilities of CoffeScript which may make you feel more comfortable in writing and structuring
your frontend code. Designing with classes and objects is more high level, than writing tons of spagetti callback oriented code.

So if you still haven't written a single line of code on CoffeeScript, I encourage you to get started immediately - you'll love it!
